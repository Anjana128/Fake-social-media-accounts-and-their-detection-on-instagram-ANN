#Overview
This repository contains an implementation of an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) using Python. ANN is a deep learning model inspired by the structure and function of the human brain, commonly used for classification and regression tasks.


#Features
Implements ANN using TensorFlow/Keras.
Supports multi-layer perceptron (MLP) architecture.
Allows hyperparameter tuning such as number of layers, activation functions, and optimizers.
Includes data preprocessing, training, and evaluation steps.


#Installation
To run the ANN algorithm, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib tensorflow scikit-learn
Alternatively, if using Jupyter Notebook, ensure all required libraries are installed before running the notebook.


#Usage
Clone this repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
Navigate to the repository:
cd your-repo
Open the Jupyter Notebook:
jupyter notebook ANN.ipynb
Run the cells sequentially to execute the ANN algorithm.


#Example
Load a dataset (e.g., MNIST, CIFAR-10, or any custom dataset).
Preprocess and normalize the data.
Define the ANN architecture with input, hidden, and output layers.
Train and evaluate the model using performance metrics.



#Results
The notebook includes performance evaluation using metrics such as accuracy, loss curves, confusion matrix, and visualization of model predictions.
